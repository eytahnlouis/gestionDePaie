Hi there,
So this project is a clocking terminal. It allows to create new employees, clock in, clock out and (in a future update) allow you to create an oversimplified monthly payslip. 

It is coded in python in majority, with the data stored in a SQL database. As for the extensions used, I used tkinter extension for the graphic display,sqlite3 to communicate to the database, and various  time related librairies.

This project is mostly in OOP because, to allow code reutulization. 

The root file is WageApp.py which main function is to create the employee, associate said employee with an unique code who will allow him to clock in and out.

This project allowed to know more about back-end programming, the Python language and use of multiples files to create projects.
